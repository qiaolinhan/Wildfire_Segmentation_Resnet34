# Wildfire_Segmentation_Resnet34
This repo is the resnet34-based segmentation for wildfire smoke and flame on ground workstation, which is to support the segmentation on-board of DJI M300.  

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 414 images which is mixed with:  
1. The wildfire data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kutaykutlu/forest-fire).
2. The experiment data from team of Prof. Yaohong Qu of Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an.  
3. The images are labled through MATLAB [labeling](https://www.mathworks.com/help/lidar/labeling.html) tool. [Labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) is also useful if it is needed to add new data into this dataset.

## Coding
